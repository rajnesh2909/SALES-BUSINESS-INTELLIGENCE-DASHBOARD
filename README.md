# SALES-BUSINESS-INTELLIGENCE-DASHBOARD

Step 1: Connected & Shaped Data

built automated workflows to extract, clean, transform, and load project data using Power Query. I explored common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, and performed table transformations.

Step 2: Created a Relational Data Model

applied data modeling best practices, including cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas. I then built the AdventureWorks data model from the ground up.

Step 3: Added Calculated Fields with DAX

used data analysis expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures, explored row and filter context, and leveraged powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns.

Step 4: Visualized Data with Reports

brought the data to life with reports and dashboards. I followed data visualization best practices, built and formatted basic charts, and added interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, and report navigation.
